# cs269q_openfermion

Use OpenFermion to retrieve DATA about the molecule. (openfermion.hamiltonians.MolecularData)

Input info about the molecule, then returns(?) all the information we need about this molecule (energy of all sorts in different interatomic distances, its HAMILTONIAN in second quantization form / quantum gate form).

.

1. Get Hamiltonian from OpenFermion

2. Use ForestOpenFermion/PyQuil to run quantum algorithm

3. Compare with classical data from OpenFermion
